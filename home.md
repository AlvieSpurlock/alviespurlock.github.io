# **Alvie Spurlock**
### Python Developer • C++ Systems Engineer • Game Developer

Welcome to my portfolio. I build fast, minimal, and intentional software — from backend tools to C++ combat simulations to game development utilities.  
Everything here links directly to my GitHub projects and itch.io builds.

## 👤 **About Me**
I’m a backend‑focused developer who loves building tools, simulations, and systems that are clean, predictable, and easy to extend.  
My work spans Python utilities, C++ combat engines, and small indie games.

I learn by doing — fast iteration, clean architecture, and intentional design.
