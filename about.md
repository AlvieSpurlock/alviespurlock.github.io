# About Me

My name is **Alvie Spurlock**, and I’m a multidisciplinary creator with a deep focus on software engineering, game development, and building tools that make development faster, cleaner, and more intentional. This portfolio is a curated look at the work I’m most proud of — the projects that reflect my discipline, my curiosity, and my drive to grow.

## Why I Do What I Do
Everything I build is rooted in purpose.  
I’m a “lead by example” kind of person — the type who believes you can’t ask others to chase their dreams if you’re not chasing your own. My wife and children are my motivation, and I want them to see firsthand what dedication looks like. Whether I succeed or fail, they’ll know that trying matters. That effort matters. That growth matters.

## 🎓 Education & Recognition
I’m currently attending **Full Sail University**, pursuing a degree in **Computer Science with a focus on Game Development**.  
I’m also a member of the **National Society of Collegiate Scholars (NSCS)**.

My education has sharpened my fundamentals, but most of the work you’ll find here wasn’t made for school — it was made because I love building things. Projects marked with an asterisk (*) are school‑related; everything else is self‑driven.

## What You’ll Find in This Portfolio
This site showcases:
- Tools that streamline development  
- C++ and Python systems built for clarity and extensibility  
- Game prototypes exploring mechanics, interaction, and design  
- Personal projects that reflect my growth as an engineer and creator  

Every page is a snapshot of my process — the way I think, the way I build, and the way I iterate.

## My Philosophy
I believe in:
- Working with intention  
- Building systems that scale  
- Learning by doing  
- Staying adaptable  
- Leading with action, not words
