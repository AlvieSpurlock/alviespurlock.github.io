# C++ Projects
A collection of systems‑level tools, simulations, and engine components written in modern C++.  
I focus on clarity, explicit logic, and predictable behavior — especially in combat systems and backend utilities.

This page will expand as more C++ projects are completed.

## 🎲 Monte Carlo Combat Simulator
A turn‑based combat simulation engine built in C++ with explicit win/loss return codes, deterministic turn order, and validated HP calculations.

**[Highlights](https://github.com/AlvieSpurlock/TTRPGCombatBalanceSimulator)**
- Explicit `int` return codes for win/loss states  
- Deterministic turn sequencing  
- Randomized monster damage with validation  
- Clean, minimal architecture  
- Designed for extensibility (future: crits, resistance, logs)

## 🧱 Future C++ Systems
Planned or in‑progress C++ projects that will be added here:

- **File I/O Helper** — A tool to HEAVILY Simplify the processes of File I/O
- **cRNG** — A tool for easier RNG ranging from Dice Rolls to Monte Carlo Framework
- **cPhysics** — A tool to make Physics as easy as a few method calls.
- **RPG Tool** — A tool to make RPG Systems much easier. From Inventory and Dialogue Frameworks to Quests and AI Templates.

These will be added as they’re completed.
