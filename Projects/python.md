# 🐍 Python Projects
A collection of tools, utilities, and backend systems built in Python.  
I focus on clean architecture, predictable behavior, and fast iteration.  
This page will grow as I continue building new tools.

## **[PyCommand](https://github.com/AlvieSpurlock/PyCommand)**
A lightweight command routing system for Python.  
Designed for small tools, CLIs, and modular utilities where functions need to be registered and invoked cleanly.

**Features**
- Register functions with a single decorator  
- Invoke commands by index or name  
- Pass parameters dynamically  
- Integrates with PyError for structured error logging

## **[PyError](https://github.com/AlvieSpurlock/PyError)**
A structured error‑logging tool that captures exceptions with timestamps, file paths, methods, and line numbers.

**Features**
- Automatic exception capture  
- Clean, readable log formatting  
- Timestamped entries  
- Perfect for debugging larger systems

## 📦 **Future Python Tools**
This section is reserved for upcoming utilities and backend systems.  
Planned additions include:

- **PyDB** — Database manager
- **PyFileCloud** — Cloud‑aware file manager  
- **PyLambdaBatch** — AWS Lambda batch runner  
- **PySecretCatcher** — Secret detection tool  

These will be added as they’re completed.
