# C++ Projects
A collection of systems‑level tools, simulations, and engine components written in modern C++.  
I focus on clarity, explicit logic, and predictable behavior — especially in combat systems and backend utilities.

This page will expand as more C++ projects are completed.

## 🎲 Monte Carlo Combat Simulator
A turn‑based combat simulation engine built in C++ with explicit win/loss return codes, deterministic turn order, and validated HP calculations.

**[Highlights]()
- Explicit `int` return codes for win/loss states  
- Deterministic turn sequencing  
- Randomized monster damage with validation  
- Clean, minimal architecture  
- Designed for extensibility (future: crits, armor, skills, logs)

## 🧱 Future C++ Systems
Planned or in‑progress C++ projects that will be added here:

- **C++ D&D Tool** — stat roller, AC calculator, HP tracker  
- **C++ Inventory System** — modular item containers with weight/slot logic  
- **C++ Combat Engine v2** — expanded version of the Monte Carlo sim  
- **C++ File Parser** — lightweight config/INI parser  
- **C++ CLI Toolkit** — reusable command‑line utilities  

These will be added as they’re completed.
